The project “Railway Reservation System” has been developed to attain a new and improved way to book tickets for the various destinations. This software is built to eliminate and, in some cases, to reduce the problems faced in by the existing system. Moreover, this system is designed for particular need of a company to carry out its operations in a smooth and effective manner.


Every Railway Management System have a lot of trains running to several destination and their booking for the passengers. The Railway Ticketing System is not understood by everyone in this world. So, this project is designed in the most simple and convenient way, so that it can be understood by everyone and is accessible by everyone easily.

The project is to develop and design a database maintaining the records of different train status and passenger. The record of train includes the train number, train name, Arrival, Destination, Availability on days where as record of train booking with the passenger details is controlled by the source code and UI Java swing. The database has been developed and tested on MySQL. The maintenance of the database also plays a major role in smooth running of the system. The railway reservation system will help in reserving the tickets of railway to travel from a particular source to the destination.


The Railway Reservation System contains the following model

- Seats Availability - The user through the use of this system can check whether the seats are available in the particular train to travel.
- Train Tickets - The user can access their train tickets through the use of this application.
- Stations - This project can also contain the details of the various stations from the source to the destination of the passenger.
- Trains - The train will be having the train name and the train number.




For this model the records are maintained in the database-
- Train Number
- Train Name
- Source
- Destination
- Fare

When we want to travel, we reserve the seat, for this we have to fill the reservation form which includes the respective details of the passenger and is displayed to the passenger with the help of Swing UI.
